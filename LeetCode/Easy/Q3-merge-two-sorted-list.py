'''
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

well.... you have to use a linked list for this problem ðŸ™‚
okay so..
a singly linked list is made up of node that contains a data val and a pointer to the next node
i need to create a node first!
'''
class Node:
    def __init__(self,data= 0, next = None): #data = data field on create nodes not linked 
        self.data = data
        self.next = next #next is the link 


print(n1.self.data)
# class LinkedList:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.head =None #empty linked list
